## Design Choices

I adhered to industry-standard design principles by prioritizing reusable components and employing Tailwind CSS and Next Themes for dynamic themes. Embracing the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, I minimized code duplication and enhanced maintainability. This approach ensures consistent design across the project while optimizing development efficiency and scalability.

## Challenges Faced

While integrating the dynamic theme, I encountered challenges with color camouflaging, so my initial task was to configure the Tailwind CSS file to ensure that themes were globally available. Next, I carefully selected colors to create the perfect background for both light and dark themes. Despite the challenges, I found it rewarding to work on such tasks.
